# Shaders for Memix by @P_Malin

I have some silly ideas for Memix shaders, if I get the chance to implement them I will post them here.

Download Memix from https://www.memix.app/

Copy a shader source to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Beautypi\Memix\shader.txt`
This should replace the "Custom" shader in memix.

Note, some of these shaders are slow. Use at your own risk, sorry if your GPU catches fire.
